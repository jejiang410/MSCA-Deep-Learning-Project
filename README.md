# Data
Dog Breed Identification (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview)

# Project Description
In this project, we built several machine learning models and deep learning models to predict the breed of a dog. Models are listed:
- Traditional Machine Learning Models
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- VGG-19
- ResNet50
- ResNet151V2
- Xception
